## FE8 Perfect Luck
Basic Idea is to rig the game in your favor, with a few exceptions. 
### Perfect Luck (Hit/Crit)
The main UPS patch (as of 11/11/23) serves to rig both your and the enemy's hit & crit rates in your favor.
In effect, it rounds your hit/crit UP to the nearest hundred, and the enemy's DOWN to the nearest hundred. It does this by setting **YOUR** hit/crit to 100 if there's a chance it occurs at all (**probability is > 0**) and setting the **ENEMY's** hit/crit to 0 if there's a chance it won't occur (**probability is < 100**).
### AlwaysPierce
Also included is a slightly related "AlwaysPierce" txt installer that's meant to be separate from the main "Perfect Luck" patch since it functions somewhat differently. AlwaysPierce basically just ensures that **ANY** Wyvern Knight will always proc Pierce. While it technically procs for enemies as well, there's only 1 enemy Wyvern Knight in the base game (Valter) so otherwise it always works in your favor. This works by simply setting the proc rate to 100 instead of using the user's level.

## Installation
### Install via UPS Patch
- This is the easiest method for installing the patch
- Get a clean ROM of FE8 and use a UPS patching program of your choice to apply the patch
